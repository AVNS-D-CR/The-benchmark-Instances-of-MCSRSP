# Multi-Constraint Satellite Range Scheduling (MCSRSP) Dataset
## 📁Overview
This dataset is designed for research on the Multi-Constraint Satellite Range Scheduling Problem (MCSRSP). This dataset provides simulated visible time windows between satellites and ground equipment, generated based on realistic operational scenarios and business rules. The data is readily usable for scheduling  without requiring additional TLE calculation.
## Compare algorithm performance using the provided instances:
1. Small-scale (C1-C5)
2. Medium-scale (C6-C9)
3. Large-scale (C10-C15)
## Dataset Structure
1. Requirements Files (TT&C requirements case_*.txt)
These files define the TT&C task requirements and constraints for each satellite requirement.
2. Time Windows Files (TT&C time windows case_*.txt)
These files define the TimeWindow and equipment-specific parameters for each orbit lap of satellite.
